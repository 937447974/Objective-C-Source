 * @function dispatch_source_cancel_and_wait
 *
 * @abstract
 * Synchronously cancel the dispatch source, preventing any further invocation
 * of its event handler block.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Cancellation prevents any further invocation of handler blocks for the
 * specified dispatch source, but does not interrupt a handler block that is
 * already in progress.
 *
 * When this function returns, any handler block that may have been in progress
 * has returned, the specified source has been unregistered and it is safe to
 * reclaim any system resource (such as file descriptors or mach ports) that
 * the specified source was monitoring.
 *
 * If the specified dispatch source is inactive, it will be activated as a side
 * effect of calling this function.
 *
 * It is possible to call this function from several threads concurrently,
 * and it is the responsibility of the callers to synchronize reclaiming the
 * associated system resources.
 *
 * This function is not subject to priority inversion when it is waiting on
 * a handler block still in progress, unlike patterns based on waiting on
 * a dispatch semaphore or a dispatch group signaled (or left) from the source
 * cancel handler.
 *
 * This function must not be called if the specified source has a cancel
 * handler set, or from the context of its handler blocks.
 *
 * This function must not be called from the context of the target queue of
 * the specified source or from any queue that synchronizes with it. Note that
 * calling dispatch_source_cancel() from such a context already guarantees
 * that no handler is in progress, and that no new event will be delivered.
 *
 * This function must not be called on sources suspended with an explicit
 * call to dispatch_suspend(), or being concurrently activated on another
 * thread.
 *
 * @param source
 * The dispatch source to be canceled.
